## Summary
Object Classification Transfer Learning Model Comparision Report.pdf


## Loss function
categorical_crossentropy - since the problem statement is about classifing the images and there are more than 2 classes or multiclasses.

## Accuracy
The accuracy of various models are very high as the transfer learning method is used. The reason for this is the pretrained models has already figured out most of the features by understanding 1000 class images with lot of variance.
Because of this reason, the training time is short and the best results are achieved from vey less number of epochs.
